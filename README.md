# Sales-Data-Analysis-for-Retail-Store-Using-Streamlit
# Overview
Sales Data Analysis for Retail Store using Streamlit-A data analysis project that leverages Streamlit to provide interactive insights into retail store sales data. This project showcases data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and business intelligence capabilities.
# Key Features
- Effortless Data Upload: Easily upload your retail store data in common formats such as CSV and Excel.
- Interactive Data Exploration:
    - Data Preview: View the first few rows of your uploaded data along with column information and data types.
    - Summary Statistics: Generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) for numerical columns.
    - Missing Value Analysis: Identify and visualize missing values in your dataset.
    - Data Filtering: Apply filters to specific columns to focus on relevant subsets of the data.
- Comprehensive Statistical Analysis:
    - Univariate Analysis: Visualize the distribution of individual variables using histograms, box plots, and density plots.
    - Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between two variables using scatter plots, bar charts (for categorical vs. numerical), and correlation matrices.
    - Time Series Analysis (if applicable): Analyze trends and seasonality in time-based data (e.g., sales over time) using line plots and basic decomposition techniques.
    - Customer Segmentation Insights: Analyze customer demographics, purchase history, and other relevant features to identify customer segments.
    - Product Performance Analysis: Evaluate the sales performance of different products, identify top-selling items, and analyze product categories.
- Interactive Visualizations: Leverage Streamlit's built-in charting capabilities (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create dynamic and informative visualizations. Users can often customize plot types and parameters.
- Downloadable Reports: Generate and download reports containing key findings, visualizations, and summary statistics in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive layout and clear instructions make it easy for users with varying levels of technical expertise to navigate and utilize the application.
- Scalability: The application can handle moderately sized datasets efficiently.
# Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language.
- Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web applications for data science and machine learning.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- Plotly (Optional): For creating interactive and dynamic plots.
- Other relevant Python libraries: (e.g., datetime for time series analysis).


# Usage
1.Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2.Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

(Replace app.py with the name of your main Streamlit script if it's different.)

3.Open your web browser to the address displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

4.Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your retail store data and perform the desired statistical analyses.

# Data Requirements
The application expects your retail store data to be in a tabular format (CSV or Excel) with clear column headers. The specific columns required will depend on the types of analyses you intend to perform. Common columns might include:

- Sales Data: Transaction ID, Date, Time, Product ID, Product Name, Category, Quantity, Unit Price, Total Revenue, Customer ID.
- Customer Data: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Location, Membership Status.
- Product Data: Product ID, Product Name, Category, Price, Cost.
Ensure your data is clean and appropriately formatted for optimal results.
